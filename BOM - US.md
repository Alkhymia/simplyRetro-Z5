this was actually the hardest one to find. I could not find any 34mm speakers. I ordered a 36mm because I figured it would be close enough, but it was too big. I replaced it with a 32mm speaker. These are very common, unlike the 34mm, and I found several inexpensive options. I tested it with a print of your case and it fits fine, some hot glue will easily keep it in place.
